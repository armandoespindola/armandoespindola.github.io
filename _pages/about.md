# <font color="blue"> Welcome to my personal research website! </font>

I am a geophysicist focusing in seismic waveform tomography in exploration, regional and global
seismology. I combine numerical methods and high performace computing to image the Earth's interior.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Department of Geosciences][https://geosciences.princeton.edu/] at Princeton University. I received my Ph.D. from the department of Earth Science and Engineering at [KAUST][https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/].
