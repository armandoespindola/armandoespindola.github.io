## <font color=#1F618D> Welcome to my personal research website! </font>

I am a geophysicist focusing in seismic waveform tomography in exploration, regional and global
seismology. I combine numerical methods and high performace computing to image the Earth's interior.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the
<a href="https://geosciences.princeton.edu/">Department of Geosciences</a> at Princeton
University. I received my Ph.D. from the department of Earth Science
and Engineering at <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/">KAUST</a>.
